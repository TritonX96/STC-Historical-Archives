# STC-Historical-Archives
Anything of historical significance to the Sunway Tech Club must and should be uploaded here for the time being. We're going to do something cool.

## FAQ for Fellow Historians

### 1. What do you actually mean by "historical significance"?<br/>
In other words... if that event didn't happen, something important today wouldn't have existed, kind of.

### 2. What's the sort of "stuff" we're supposed to upload here? <br/>
Photos, documents, videos, chats, drawings, songs... anything that allows us to travel back in time iykwim.

### 3. Deadline?<br/>
Yes, this is a short-term archive. All the stuff here will be used in a special mini-something for the Club.
Suggested cut-off: End of August 2020
